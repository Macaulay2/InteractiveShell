Dear ***

InteractiveShell is an ongoing project with the goal of offering mathematical
software online without registration. The idea is twofold: On the one hand
mathematicians should be able to test the software before having to go through
the possibly hard installation process. On the other hand we want to make it
easier to use mathematical software for teaching and lectures.

InteractiveShell originated from the tryM2 project. One can find a server
running InteractiveShell and offering Macaulay2 at web.macaulay2.com. The
website provides tutorials and the possibility to upload custom tutorials
provided by teachers. 

The complete code and documentation is available in a github repository and
thus one can easily set up a custom server. This makes the platform ideal for
the use in lectures and courses. 


In collaboration with Kaiserslautern we want to offer the computer algebra
system Singular via this method as well.  Internally the system relies on
methods which contain the offered program securely, such as linux containers.
Every user is connected in the background to a container via ssh. This makes it
easy to just use parts of it as desired. If one wants to use chroots instead of
linux containers, one only needs to replace the module managing the containers.

We will give a detailed overview and demonstration of all features implemented and
planned, as well as report on the internal structure of the system.
