          We assume you&rsquo;ve installed <em>Macaulay2</em> and can type<BR>
          on a command line to bring up the program. You should see something like:<BR>
          We suggest you do that now, so that you can experiment while you read
          this tutorial!

    <h4>Arithmetic with integers, rings and ideals</h4>
          You can immediately do arithmetic with integers:<BR>
        <code>2+2</code><br>
        <code>107*431</code><br>
        <code>25!</code><br>
        <code>binomial(5,4)</code><br>
        <code>factor 32004</code><br>

          Most <em>Macaulay2</em> applications involve polynomial rings over fields
          and their quotient rings. Fields can be made in various ways:<BR>
        <code>ZZ/101</code><br>
        <code>QQ</code><br>
        <!--code>GF 2^5</code><br-->
        <code>k = toField (QQ[i]/(i^2+1))</code><br>
          After making <tt>k</tt> we can compute in it:<BR>
        <code>1/i</code><br>

          Computation is often fastest and needs least
          memory when performed over finite prime fields of the form 
          <i>&#x2124;/p</i>.
          Fortunately, when the characteristic <i>p</i> is not too small,
          qualitative questions often have similar answers over
          <i>&#x2124;/p</i> and over <i>&#x211A;</i>, so we mostly use the former.
          In <em>Macaulay2</em> the prime <i>p</i>
          can range up to 32749.

          We make a polynomial ring in 5 variables over <i>&#x2124;/101</i>:<BR>
        <code>kk=ZZ/101</code><br>
        <code>S=kk[x_1..x_5]</code><br>
          Here is another way:<BR>
        <code>S=kk[a,b,c,d,e] </code><br>
          One can do arithmetic on polynomials:<BR>
        <code>(3*a^2+1)^5</code><br>

          We make an ideal in <i>S</i>:<BR>
        <code>I=ideal(a^3-b^3, a+b+c+d+e)</code><br>
          Using this ideal, we can make a factor ring:<BR>
        <code>R=S/I</code><br>
          Another way to make an ideal, with more compact notation (familiar to anyone who used the
          classic Macaulay) is:<BR>
        <code>use S</code><br>
        <code>I=ideal"3(a+b)3, 4c5"</code><br>
          Note the command &ldquo;<tt>use S</tt>&rdquo;, which specifies 
          that we want to work with the generators of the polynomial ring S again;
          otherwise the variables <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, and <tt>c</tt>
          would still have had values in <i>R</i> instead of in <i>S</i>.

          Algebraic operations on ideals are available:<BR>
        <code>I^2</code><br>
        <code>I*I</code><br>
        <code>I+ideal"a2"</code><br>

        <!-->  In case you forget any of these things, <tt>help</tt> is available! The most
          useful way to get it is often to type something like:<BR>
	<code>help ideal</code><br>
          Then a browser window will pop up that contains documentation about the function <tt>ideal</tt> that we&rsquo;ve been using; links on that page allow one to explore all of the <em>Macaulay2</em> documentation.

          On the other hand, we might have wanted information about the <tt>class</tt> of all ideals.
          Not too surprisingly, this class is called <tt>Ideal</tt>. We could get information about
          what functions create or use ideals by typing:<BR>
          To see the names of classes, you can begin by looking at the output
          of commands; the second line output (the one introduced by a colon) often contains the name of the 
          class of the result. -->
          
          Here are some basic operations on matrices:<BR>
        <code>M= matrix{{a,b,c},{b,c,d},{c,d,e}}</code><br>
        <code>M^2</code><br>
        <code>determinant M</code><br>
        <code>trace M</code><br>
        <code>M-transpose M</code><br>
          The function <tt>entries</tt> gives the entries of a matrix:<BR>
        <code>entries M</code><br>
          The result is a list of lists, one for each row of the matrix <i>M</i>.
          The function <tt>flatten</tt> can be used to merge the
          lists into a single list:<BR>
        <code>flatten entries M</code><br>
          If you want a particular entry, say the one in the upper left corner, 
          you can use the underscore operator <tt>_</tt>:<BR>
        <code>M_(0,0)</code><br>
          Here, as everywhere in <em>Macaulay2</em>, all indexing starts with 0.
          For example:<BR>
        <code>I_0</code><br>
          is the first generator of I. You can list all the generators with:<BR>
        <code>I_*</code><br>

          A <em>module</em> can be defined as a cokernel, kernel, image, or even as a subquotient:<BR>
        <code>coker M     </code><br>
        <code>image M</code><br>
        <code>kernel matrix"a,b,0;0,a,b"</code><br>
        <code>N = matrix{{a,b},{b,c},{c,d}}</code><br>
        <code>(image M)/(image N)</code><br>
        <code>subquotient(M,N)</code><br>
         Note that the matrix <i>N</i> above was defined with an
         alternate syntax, parallel to the alternate syntax for <tt>ideal</tt>.

          <!-- Before going on, the reader might want to explore a bit. A good place to 
          start is the top of the documentation tree, which can be reached, for
          example, by typing:<BR-->

    <h4>Properties of ideals and modules</h4>
          To compute the Gröbner basis of an ideal
          <i>(x<sup>2</sup>y,xy<sup>2</sup>+x<sup>3</sup>)</i> in the polynomial ring in
          four variables we proceed as follows.
          First we make our favorite field:<BR>
        <code>kk = ZZ/32003</code><br>
          Then the polynomial ring:<BR>
        <code>R = kk[x,y,z,w]</code><br>
          And then the ideal:<BR>
        <code>I = ideal(x^2*y,x*y^2+x^3)</code><br>
          Now the punch line.  We compute the Gröbner basis with the <tt>groebnerBasis</tt> function:<BR>
        <code>J = groebnerBasis I</code><br>

          Gr&ouml;bner bases are always computed with respect to a particular
          monomial order on the ring. In fact, the ring we defined above has
          a default monomial order, the graded reverse lex order. For many
          other possibilities, see the documentation. <!--tt>MonomialOrder</tt>, or type:<BR--><br>

          The analogue of factorization in the theory of ideals
          is primary decomposition.
          For example, we can begin by intersecting three ideals:<BR>
        <code>I= intersect (ideal"x2,y3", ideal"y2,z3", (ideal"x,y,z")^4)</code><br>
          We can almost undo this operation by computing
          a primary decomposition:<BR>
        <code>primaryDecomposition I</code><br>
          Inspecting the output, we see that the first two ideals
          are the same as the first two ideals we intersected, but the 
          third one differs from the corresponding input ideal.
          This is because only the primary components corresponding
          to minimal primes (here, the first two) are unique. All three of the input ideals
          are primary, so they constitute a primary decomposition of <i>I</i>
          different from the one provided by <em>Macaulay2</em> on the output line.
          
          For larger examples, primary decomposition is computationally challenging!
          Sometimes it is easier to compute just the minimal primes. To do
          this we can use <tt>decompose</tt>: <BR>
        <code>decompose I</code><br>

          Using Gröbner bases we can compute 
          codimensions, dimensions,
          degrees, Hilbert
          functions, and Hilbert polynomials.  
          This will be more fun if we work with a
          meaningful example.  We will use
          the ideal defining the smooth
          rational quartic curve in <i>&#x2119;<sup>3</sup></i> given
          parametrically (in an affine representation)
          by <p align=center><i>t ↦ (t,t<sup>3</sup>,t<sup>4</sup>).</i></p>
          (The reader more interested in algebra than geometry
          may simply treat the ideal given below as a 
          gift from the gods.)
          First we make the
          polynomial ring in 4 variables, to serve as the
          homogeneous coordinate ring of <i>&#x2119;<sup>3</sup></i>:<BR>
        <code>R = kk[a..d]</code><br>
          We introduce the ring map <i>&phi;: R &rarr;kk[s,t]</i> defined by 
          <i>(a,b,c,d) ↦ (s<sup>4</sup>, s<sup>3</sup> t, s t<sup>3</sup>, t<sup>4</sup>)</i>:         <BR>
        <code>phi = map(kk[s,t],R,{s^4, s^3*t, s*t^3, t^4})</code><br>
          Here the syntax of the function <tt>map</tt> has the target ring first and the source ring second:
          maps in <em>Macaulay2</em> generally go from right to left!
          The last input to the command is a 
          list of the elements to which to send the variables of the source ring.
          The ideal we want is the kernel of this map:<BR>
        <code>I = ker phi</code><br>
          Shortcut notation for this construction is provided by the function <tt>monomialCurveIdeal</tt>:<BR>
        <code>I = monomialCurveIdeal(R,{1,3,4})</code><br>
          We can compute the <tt>dimension</tt>, <tt>codimension</tt> (also called the
          height) and <tt>degree</tt> of this ideal:<BR>
        <code>dim I</code><br>
        <code>codim I</code><br>
        <code>degree I</code><br>
          The Hilbert polynomial is obtained with the function <tt>hilbertPolynomial</tt>:<BR>
        <code>hilbertPolynomial(R/I)</code><br>
          The output above may not be what the user expected:
          the term <i><b>P</b><sub>m</sub></i> represents the Hilbert polynomial of
          projective <i>m</i>-space.  Thus the output tells
          us that the Hilbert polynomial of <i>M</i> is
          <i>i ↦ -3*1+4*(i+1) = 4i + 1</i>.  Thus the degree
          is four, the dimension of the projective variety
          that is the support of <i>M</i> is 1 (and so the affine
          dimension is 2), and the (arithmetic) genus is 0 (obtained as 1 minus the
          constant term of the polynomial.)

          The more usual expression for the Hilbert polynomial can
          be obtained as follows:<BR>
        <code>hilbertPolynomial(R/I, Projective => false)</code><br>
          The construction <tt>Projective => false</tt> is our first example of
          an <em>option</em> to a function: we specified that the option 
          <tt>Projective</tt> was to have the value <tt>false</tt>.
          The form we used first could also have been written this way:<BR>
        <code>hilbertPolynomial(R/I, Projective => true)</code><br>
          The Hilbert series of <i>M</i> (the generating function
          for the dimensions of the graded pieces of <i>M</i>) is
          obtained with:<BR>
        <code>hilbertSeries (R/I)</code><br>
          This generating function is expressed
          as a rational function with denominator equal to (1-T)<sup>n</sup>, where
          n is the number of variables in R. 
          Since R/I has dimension 2, it can also be written
          with denominator (1-t)<sup>2</sup>. To see it in this form, use <tt>reduceHilbert</tt>:<BR>
        <code>reduceHilbert hilbertSeries (R/I)</code><br>
          It is possible to manipulate the numerator and denominator of this
          expression. <!--To learn how to do so, see <tt>hilbertSeries</tt> or type:-->	<BR>

          A great deal of subtle information about a module is visible using
          free resolutions. For an example, we begin
          by turning <i>R/I</i> into a module. Here the code <tt>R<sup>1</sup></tt> produces the free module of
          rank 1 over <i>R</i>, and <tt>res</tt> computes a free resolution:<BR>
        <code>M=R^1/I</code><br>
        <code>Mres = res M</code><br>
          To get more precise information about <tt>Mres</tt>,
          we could compute its Betti table with <tt>betti</tt>:<BR>
        <code>betti Mres</code><br>
          The display is chosen for compactness. Each column of the
          table corresponds
          to a free module in the resolution. The column&rsquo;s heading
          specifies the <em>homological degree</em> (the position of the free
          module in the resolution).
          The entry just below the homological degree
          is the rank of the free module, also called the
          <em>total betti 
          number</em>. The remaining entries in the column
          tell us how many generators of each degree this free
          module has: the number in the column labelled <i>j</i> and in the row labelled <i>d</i>
          tells how many generators of degree <i>j+d</i> the <i>j</i>-th free module has.
          Thus, in our case, the single
          generator of the third (and last) free module in the
          resolution has degree <i>3+2=5</i>.<br>

          Commonly computed homological invariants
          such as <tt>projective dimension</tt> and <tt>regularity</tt> are (also) available directly:<BR>
        <code>pdim M</code><br>
        <code>regularity M</code><br>

     <BR>

    <h4>Division With Remainder</h4>
          A major application of Gröbner bases is
          to give the normal form for an element modulo an
          ideal, allowing one, for example, to decide whether
          the element is in the ideal.
          For example, we can decide which power of the trace
          of a generic 3x3 matrix is expressible in terms of the entries of the 
          cube of the matrix with the following code:<BR>
				<code>kk = ZZ/32003</code><br>
        <code>R = kk[a..i]</code><br>
        <code>M = genericMatrix(R,a,3,3)</code><br>
        <code>I = ideal M^3</code><br>
          This gives the ideal of entries of the matrix. In the expression
          &ldquo;<tt>M = genericMatrix(R,a,3,3)</tt>&rdquo; the arguments &ldquo;<tt>R,a,3,3</tt>&rdquo; specify the
          ring, the first variable to use, and the numbers of rows and columns
          desired.<BR>
        <code>Tr = trace M </code><br>
        <code>for p from 1 to 10 do print (Tr^p % I)</code><br>
          The expression &ldquo;<tt>Tr<sup>p</sup> % I</tt>&rdquo; computes the normal form for the p-th power
          of the trace <tt>Tr</tt> with respect to the Gröbner basis of I.
          The expression &ldquo;<tt>for p from 1 to 10 do</tt>&rdquo; specifies a 
          <em>for loop</em> that executes the following expression, &ldquo;<tt>print (Tr<sup>p</sup> % I)</tt>&rdquo;,
          with 10 consecutive values of <tt>p</tt>. <!-- For more information on such loops see <tt>for</tt>
          or type:--><BR>
          <!--Here we have put quotes around &ldquo;for&rdquo; because
          &ldquo;for&rdquo; is a keyword in the <em>Macaulay2</em> language.  (In general, it&rsquo;s always safe to use
          quotes with viewHelp.)--><br>

          We see from the output of these commands that the 6-th power
          of the trace is NOT in the ideal of entries of the cube of M,
          but the 7-th power is. We can compute the coefficients in the expression for it 
          using the division algorithm, denoted in this setting by <tt>//</tt>:<BR>
        <code>Tr^7//(gens I)</code><br>
     
     <BR>

<div>
    <h4>Elimination Theory</h4>
          Consider the problem of projecting the
          &ldquo;twisted cubic&rdquo;, a curve in <i>&#x2119;<sup>3</sup></i> defined
          by the three <i>2 &times; 2</i> minors of a certain
          <i>2 &times; 3</i> matrix.  
          We already have the simplest tools for solving
          such a problem.
          We first clear the earlier meaning of <tt>x</tt> 
          to allow it to be used as a subscripted variable:<BR>
        <code>x = symbol x</code><br>
          Since we are going to deal with a curve in <i>&#x2119;<sup>3</sup></i>,
          we begin with a polynomial ring in four variables:<BR>
				<code>kk = ZZ/32003</code><br>
        <code>R = kk[x_0..x_3] </code><br>
          The ideal of the twisted cubic curve is generated by the <i>2 &times; 2</i>
          minors of a &ldquo;catalecticant" or &ldquo;Hankel" matrix, conveniently
          defined as follows:<BR>
        <code>M = map(R^2, 3, (i,j)->x_(i+j))</code><br>
        <code>I = minors(2,M)</code><br>
          As projection center we
          take the point with homogeneous coordinates <i>(1,0,0,-1)</i>,
          which is defined by the ideal:<BR>
        <code>pideal = ideal(x_0+x_3, x_1, x_2)</code><br>
          The ideal J of the image of the curve under the projection from this point
          is the kernel of the ring map <i>S=kk[u,v,w] &rarr;R/I</i>
          sending the variables
          of S to the generators of <tt>pIdeal</tt>,
          regarded as elements of <i>R/I</i>.  This is the same as the more usual formulation:
          <p align=center><i>J = I &cap; kk[x<sub>0</sub>+x<sub>3</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>x</sub>]</i></p> 
          To compute this we first substitute <tt>pIdeal</tt> into <i>R/I</i>, and then form
          the necessary ring map:<BR>
        <code>Rbar = R/I</code><br>
        <code>pideal = substitute(pideal, Rbar)</code><br>
        <code>S = kk[u,v,w]</code><br>
        <code>J=kernel map (Rbar, S, gens pideal)</code><br>
          The ideal J defines a curve with one singular point.
          We can compute the ideal of the singular locus with:<BR>
        <code>K = ideal singularLocus(J)</code><br>
          This doesn&rsquo;t look like the ideal of a reduced point! But
          that&rsquo;s because it isn&rsquo;t yet saturated:<BR>
        <code>saturate K</code><br>
          We have just seen the <tt>saturate</tt> function in its most
          common use: to saturate with respect to the maximal ideal.
          but we can also find the saturation of any ideal with
          respect to another:<BR>
        <code>saturate (ideal"u3w,uv", ideal"u")</code><br>
          We can also take the &ldquo;ideal quotient&rdquo; I:J of an ideal I with
          respect to another, J
          defined as the set of elements f such that
          f*J is contained in I:<BR>
        <code>ideal"u3w,uv":ideal"u"</code><br>
     
     <BR>
</div>

    <h4>Defining functions and loading packages</h4>
          It is easy to define your own functions in <em>Macaulay2</em>, and this
          can save a lot of typing. Functions are defined with the 
          symbol ->. For example, the famous <em>Collatz Conjecture</em>
          (also called the &ldquo;hailstone problem&rdquo;) asks
          about the following procedure: given an integer <i>n</i>, divide it
          by 2 if possible, or else multiply by 3 and add 1. 
          If we repeat this over and over,
          does the process always reach 1?  Here is a function that 
          performs the Hailstone procedure again and again,
          producing a list of the intermediate results.<BR>
        <code>Collatz = n -><br>
							while n != 1 list if n%2 == 0 then n=n//2 else n=3*n+1</code><br>
          For example:<BR>
        <code>Collatz 27</code><br>
          If you don&rsquo;t understand this code easily, see <tt>Function</tt> and <tt>while</tt> in the documentation.<BR>
          In order to understand a process it is often useful to tabulate the 
          results of applying it many times. One feature of the Collatz process
          is how many steps it takes to get to 1. We can tabulate this statistic
          for the first 25 values of n with the function <tt>tally</tt>, as follows:<BR>
        <code>tally for n from 1 to 30 list length Collatz n</code><br>
          A line of the form <tt>18 =&gt3</tt>
          in the result means that a Collatz sequence of length 18
          was seen 3 times. 
          To see the successive &ldquo;record-breakers&rdquo;, 
          that is, the numbers with longer Collatz sequences than any
          number before them, we might try:<BR>
        <code>record = length Collatz 1</code><br>
	      <code>L = for n from 2 to 1000 list (<br>
	            	l := length Collatz n;<br>
	      				if l > record <br>
	      				then (record = l; (n,l))<br>
	      				else continue)</code><br>
          If you want to see a list of just the successive records, 
          you can apply the 
          function <tt>last</tt> to each element of the list <i>L</i>. 
          A convenient way to do this is with this syntax:<BR>
        <code>L/last</code><br>

          Note that in
          writing functions of more than one expression (usually
          there&rsquo;s one expression per line), the expressions must be
          separated by semicolons. For example in the &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop
          above, the first expression was &ldquo;<tt>l = length Collatz n</tt>&rdquo;. 
          After the last expression of an input line or of a function body,
          a semicolon suppresses output, useful when the output
          would be large.         
          
          There are many packages of ready-made functions available for
          your use, many written by other users (perhaps you&rsquo;ll contribute one
          someday!).<!-- A list of &ldquo;installed&rdquo; packages can be found with:<BR-->
          For example, there is a package called <tt>EdgeIdeals::EdgeIdeals</tt>. 
          To load the package, use:<BR>
        <code>loadPackage "EdgeIdeals"</code><br>
          After loading it, <!--you can view its documentation with <BR>
          or--> you can call its functions, 
          such as <tt>EdgeIdeals::randomGraph</tt> and <tt>EdgeIdeals::edgeIdeal</tt>:<BR>
	<code>kk = ZZ/32003</code><br>
        <code>R = kk[vars(0..10)]</code><br>
        <code>G=randomGraph (R,20)</code><br>
        <code>K=edgeIdeal G</code><br>
        <code>hilbertSeries K</code><br>
        <code>betti res K</code><br>

          When testing a conjecture  one sometimes wants to run a 
          large number of randomly chosen
          examples.
          Here&rsquo;s some typical code that one might use to study
          a random graph ideal.  First we use &ldquo;<tt>for ... list ...</tt>&rdquo; to construct a list <tt>L</tt>
          and suppress its printing by ending the line that creates
          it with a &ldquo;;&rdquo;.  Each entry of <tt>L</tt> is a triple consisting of the
          codimension, degree, and Betti table of a random graph ideal
          on 10 vertices having only 4 edges.<BR>
        <code>R = ZZ/2[vars(0..10)]</code><br>
        <code>L=for j from 1 to 100 list(</code><br>
        <code>I = edgeIdeal randomGraph (R,5);</code><br>
        <code>(codim I, degree I, betti res I));</code><br>
          We can use <tt>tally</tt> to find out how many examples
          were found with each combination of codimension and degree and Betti table.<BR>
        <code>tally L</code><br>
          We can determine how many distinct patterns were found:<BR>
        <code>#tally L</code><br>

    <h4>Ext, Tor, and cohomology</h4>
          <em>Macaulay2</em> can compute the homology of complexes;
          for example, let&rsquo;s compute the homology of a
          Koszul complex that is not a resolution:
          <p align=center><i> <b>K</b>(x<sup>2</sup>, x y<sup>2</sup>):&nbsp;&nbsp;0 &rarr; S(-5) &rarr; S(-2)&oplus;S(-3) &rarr; S &rarr;0 </i></p>
          The free module <i>S(-2) &oplus; S(-3)</i> can be defined with this
          syntax:<BR>				
		<code>kk = ZZ/32003</code><br>
	<code>S = kk[u,v,w]</code><br>
        <code>S^{-2,-3} </code><br>
          Here is how we can define the maps in the Koszul complex:<BR>
        <code>S = kk[x,y]</code><br>
        <code>phi1 = map(S^1, S^{-2,-3}, matrix"x2,xy2")</code><br>
        <code>phi2 = map(S^{-2,-3}, S^{-5}, matrix"xy2;-x2")</code><br>
          Let&rsquo;s check that this is will really make a complex:<BR>
        <code>phi1*phi2</code><br>
          To get the homology we can, for example compute:<BR>
        <code>(ker phi1)/(image phi2)</code><br>
          We could also use the data type <tt>ChainComplex</tt> 
          and use a built-in facility to take homology (in our case <i>H<sub>1</sub></i>):<BR>
        <code>FF = chainComplex(phi1,phi2)</code><br>
        <code>FF.dd</code><br>
        <code>homology FF</code><br>
        <code>presentation (homology FF)_1</code><br>
          Either way, the first homology is <i>((x<sup>2</sup>):(xy<sup>2</sup>)) / (x<sup>2</sup>) &#8773; S/(x)</i>, in accord
          with general theory.

          There are other ways to construct Koszul complexes.  One way is as the tensor product of
          chain complexes of length 1:<BR>
        <code>FF = chainComplex matrix {{x^2}} ** chainComplex matrix {{x*y^2}}</code><br>
        <code>FF.dd</code><br>
          Another way is by using the function <tt>koszul</tt>, designed for that purpose:<BR>
        <code>FF = koszul matrix {{x^2, x*y^2}}</code><br>
        <code>FF.dd</code><br>

          Since <em>Macaulay2</em> can compute resolutions and homology, it can
          compute things such as <i>Ext</i>, <i>Tor</i> and sheaf cohomology, as in the 
          following examples. The first uses Serre&rsquo;s formula to compute
          the multiplicity with which a 2-plane meets the union
          of two 2-planes in 4-space (this is the first case in which
          the length of the intersection scheme is NOT the right answer.)
          The notation &ldquo;<tt>M**N</tt>&rdquo; denotes the tensor product of the modules <i>M</i> and <i>N</i>.
          We use the syntactical forms
          &ldquo;<tt>for j from 0 to 4 list ...</tt>&rdquo; to list some results and
          &ldquo;<tt>sum(0..4, j -> ...)</tt>&rdquo; to sum some results.<BR>
        <code>S=kk[a,b,c,d]</code><br>
        <code>IX = intersect(ideal(a,b), ideal(c,d))</code><br>
        <code>IY = ideal(a-c, b-d)</code><br>
        <code>degree ((S^1/IX) ** (S^1/IY))</code><br>
        <code>for j from 0 to 4 list degree Tor_j(S^1/IX, S^1/IY)</code><br>
        <code>sum(0..4, j-> (-1)^j * degree Tor_j(S^1/IX, S^1/IY))</code><br>
          Similarly, we can compute Hom and Ext:<BR>
        <code>Hom(IX, S^1/IX)</code><br>
        <code>Ext^1(IX, S^1/IX)</code><br>
          or the cohomology of the sheaf associated to a module. 

          Here is how to compute
          the first cohomology of the structure
          sheaf twisted by <i>-2</i> of the curve <i>Proj(S/IX)</i>, which
          in this case is the disjoint union of two
          lines in <i>&#x2119;<sup>3</sup></i>:<BR>
        <code>HH^1 (sheaf (S^{-2}**(S^1/IX)))</code><br>
