  <h4>Getting started</h4>

  <p>In this tutorial, we will show how to use this web site effectively.</p>

  <p>Every tutorial usually consists of a number of pages, with highlighted Macaulay2
  code.</p>
  
  <p>If you click or tap on the highlighted Macaulay2 code, the code will
  be sent to the server, and evaluated.  The result will be displayed in the right hand window.
  For example</p>

  <code>R = QQ[x,y,z]</code><br>
  <code>F = (x-1)^3 - (y-1)^3</code><br>
  <code>factor F</code><br>

  <p>You are on the first page of this tutorial.  At the top of the window, you see how many pages are
  in this tutorial.  After you are finished with a page, click or tap on the right arrow key.  You can also go back to previous pages of the tutorial by clicking on the left arrow button.</p>

  <p>Right now, please continue to the next page of the tutorial.</p>

  <h4>Getting Macaulay2 help on a topic</h4>

  <p>There are two main ways of getting help on a topic in Macaulay2.  The first method gives you
  text help in the Macaulay2 output window.  For example,</p>
  <code>help determinant</code><br>
  <p>This displays in the Macaulay2 output window how to use the function "determinant".
  <b>Note!</b> In many browsers, you will have scroll bars to go back, but in some, notably most versions
  of Safari, the scrollbars are there but hidden!
  </p>

  <p>Alternatively, and more usefully, you may obtain the web version by using:</p>
  <code>viewHelp determinant</code><br>

  <p>This opens the documentation page in another browser window or tab.  You can surf through the links
  there to see other Macaulay2 documentation.</p>

  <p>Depending on your browser settings, you may be navigated to this new page,
  or not.  Your Macaulay2 web session is still active in any case! You might
  need to disable popup window blocking in your browser in order to get the
  help page.</p>

  <p><b>How to type that yourself!?</b>
  See the next page of this tutorial!</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>Using the <b>Input</b> Window</h4>

  <p>Clicking or tapping the <b>Input</b> button at the top of the page, navigates you to the Input Window.
  This is where you may type in Macaulay2 code and have it evaluated.</p>
 
   <p>In that window, place your cursor on a line that you wish to evaluate, and either click the
  <b>Evaluate</b> button, or press Shift-Return (both keys at the same time).</p>

  <p>Alternatively, you may select several lines, or a part of a line, and click
  <b>Evaluate</b> (or press Shift-Return), will evaluate the selection.</p>

  <p>You try it!  Navigate to that page, type in some Macaulay2 input, or try out some of the example
  lines already there.  When you are ready to come back to the tutorial, click or tap on the
  <b>Tutorial</b> button at the top of the page.  You will end up right here!

   <p><b>To save your work:</b>
  Click on the <b>Save</b> button at the top of the top right of the window.  A dialog will appear
  where you can save the text in the <b>Input</b> window, or the text in the Macaulay2 output (or both).
  Alternatively, you can just select the text you wish, and copy it.
  </p>
  
</div>

<div>
  <h4>Macaulay2 sessions and the Reset button</h4>
  
  <p> When your browser starts, it starts a Macaulay2 process on our server.
  All of your input, either typed and evaluated, or run by pressing buttons,
  goes to this process.  If you open a second window or tab in the same
  browser, you will get the same session.
  </p>

  <p>
  You might wish to start fresh, or restart Macaulay2, if a computation is
  going on too long.  In this case, press the <b>Reset</b> button at the top of
  the page.
  </p>

  <p>
  When you first connect to this web site, a cookie is generated, and that is used to connect to
  your Macaulay2 process on the server.  If you quit your browser, and it is set to remember windows, then
  it remembers the cookie, and you can reconnect back to the same session.  If not, then a new session
  is created.  The server will remove the session after some length of time, currently several days or a week.
  </p>

  <p>
  Sometimes the server must be restarted for maintenance or other reasons, and at those times, all sessions
  are terminated.

  <h4>Advanced topics</h4>
  <h4>Uploading files</h4>

  <p>Use the <b>Upload File</b> button to upload files to the Macaulay2 server that can then be loaded into your Macaulay2 session. Suppose that you have uploaded a file named <tt>foo.m2</tt> which contains Macaulay2 code.
  You may then load this file into Macaulay2 using either:
  </p>
  
  <code>load "foo.m2"</code><br>

  <p>
  or, if you wish to see all of the lines executed one by one:
  </p>
  
  <code>input "foo.m2"</code><br>

  
  <p><b>Note</b>: these lines will likely give errors now, as the file
    <tt>foo.m2</tt> probably doesn't exist on the server</p>

  <h4>Restrictions in place for the Macaulay2 server</h4>

  <p>The server is being shared with other users, therefore memory and CPU time
  are limited (generous, but limited).  Other restrictions include: upload file size, number of processes that
  can run, and the amount of time that the session is saved on the server.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Running shell commands from within Macaulay2</h4>

  <p>It is possible to run shell commands from within Macaulay2, although many operations are restricted.
  For example, to see what files you have in your home directory, try:</p>
  <code>get "!ls"</code><br>

  <p>Typically, there will be no files shown in your home directory, unless you have created them
  or uploaded them.</p>

  <h4>Macaulay2 and image files</h4>

  <p>Sometimes Macaulay2 or one of its packages generates image files that are then downloaded to
  your machine. For example, the displayGraph function creates a jpeg file that gets downloaded so you :
  </p>
    <code> needsPackage "Graphs"</code><br>
    <code>A = graph({{x_1,x_3},{x_2,x_4},{x_1,x_4}})</code><br>
    <code>displayGraph A</code><br>

  <h4>Getting files back to your machine</h4>

  <p>
  Sometimes your Macaulay2 code will create a file as output.  How to download
  this onto your machine?  Here is one way.  This first line creates a file for
  the purpose of this example.
  </p>
  
  <code>"important-results.txt" << "very important results" << close</code>

  <p>The next line will present a download dialog for you to obtain the file on your machine.
  </p>
  
  <code>get "!open important-results.txt"</code><br>

  <p>To see help on a Macaulay2 topic, 
  <p>
  To get started, select a tutorial from Index. Click on any
  highlighted code, Macaulay2 will execute it. The result is displayed on the
  right. Alternatively, you can use <b>Input</b> on the left to
  write your own commands. Execute a line or selection by positioning your cursor on it and
  click on the Evaluate button (or type Shift-Enter). You can switch back to
  the tutorial at any time. </p>

  <code>viewHelp "set"</code><br>
  
  <code> needsPackage "Graphs"<br>
  A = graph({{x_1,x_3},{x_2,x_4},{x_1,x_4}})<br>
  displayGraph A</code><p><code>4+3*9</code><br>

  <code>apply(10, i -> i *17)</code><br>
  <code>R = ZZ/3[a,b,c]</code><br>
  <code>groebnerBasis ideal(a^2, a*b-b*b, -c^2)</code><br>
