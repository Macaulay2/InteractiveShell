  <h4>Getting started</h4>

  <p>In this tutorial, we will show how to use this web site effectively.</p>

  <p>Every tutorial usually consists of a number of pages, with highlighted Macaulay2
  code.</p>
  
  <p>If you click or tap on the highlighted Macaulay2 code, the code will
  be sent to the server, and evaluated.  The result will be displayed in the right hand window.
  For example</p>

  <code>R = QQ[x,y,z]</code><br>
  <code>F = (x-1)^3 - (y-1)^3</code><br>
  <code>factor F</code><br>

  <p>You are on the first page of this tutorial.  At the top of the window, you see how many pages are
  in this tutorial.  After you are finished with a page, click or tap on the right arrow key.  You can also go back to previous pages of the tutorial by clicking on the left arrow button.</p>

  <p>Right now, please continue to the next page of the tutorial.</p>

  <h4>Getting Macaulay2 help on a topic</h4>

  <p>There are two main ways of getting help on a topic in Macaulay2.  The first method gives you
  text help in the Macaulay2 output window.  For example,</p>
  <code>help determinant</code><br>
  <p>This displays in the Macaulay2 output window how to use the function "determinant".
  <b>Note!</b> In many browsers, you will have scroll bars to go back, but in some, notably most versions
  of Safari, the scrollbars are there but hidden!
  </p>

  <p>Alternatively, and more usefully, you may obtain the web version by using:</p>
  <code>viewHelp determinant</code><br>

  <p>This opens the documentation page in another browser window or tab.  You can surf through the links
  there to see other Macaulay2 documentation.</p>

  <p>Depending on your browser settings, you may be navigated to this new page,
  or not.  Your Macaulay2 web session is still active in any case! You might
  need to disable popup window blocking in your browser in order to get the
  help page.</p>

  <p><b>How to type that yourself!?</b>
  See the next page of this tutorial!</p>

<div>
    <h4>Using the <b>Input</b> Window</h4>

  <p>Clicking or tapping the <b>Input</b> button at the top of the page, navigates you to the Input Window.
  This is where you may type in Macaulay2 code and have it evaluated.</p>
 
   <p>In that window, place your cursor on a line that you wish to evaluate, and either click the
  <b>Evaluate</b> button, or press Shift-Return (both keys at the same time).</p>

  <p>Alternatively, you may select several lines, or a part of a line, and click
  <b>Evaluate</b> (or press Shift-Return), will evaluate the selection.</p>

  <p>You try it!  Navigate to that page, type in some Macaulay2 input, or try out some of the example
  lines already there.  When you are ready to come back to the tutorial, click or tap on the
  <b>Tutorial</b> button at the top of the page.  You will end up right here!

  <p>To see help on a Macaulay2 topic, 
  <p>
  To get started, select a tutorial from Index. Click on any
  highlighted code, Macaulay2 will execute it. The result is displayed on the
  right. Alternatively, you can use <b>Input</b> on the left to
  write your own commands. Execute a line or selection by positioning your cursor on it and
  click on the Evaluate button (or type Shift-Enter). You can switch back to
  the tutorial at any time. </p>
