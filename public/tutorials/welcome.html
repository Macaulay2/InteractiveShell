          We assume you&rsquo;ve installed <em>Macaulay2</em> and can type<BR>
          on a command line to bring up the program. You should see something like:<BR>
          We suggest you do that now, so that you can experiment while you read
          this tutorial!

Click on any highlighted code, Macaulay2 will execute it. The result is displayed on the right. Alternatively, you can use the <b>Input Terminal</b> on the left to write your own commands. Execute a line by positioning your cursor on it and click on the Evaluate button (or type Shift-Enter).
