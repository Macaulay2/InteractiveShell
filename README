This will be the great tryM2.com!

# The fife and tail into M2 must already be running, the pipe must have
# correct permissions
# do this to set up the pipe

#inside the tryM2 direcotyr: 

# > mkfifo ppp
# > chmod 777 ppp
# > touch results.txt
# > chmod 777 results.txt
# > tail -f ppp | M2 > results.txt
