# Interactive Shell

## Purpose

A node.js webserver that serves an interactive Math Program command line.

See [Macaulay2](http://web.macaulay2.com)  and [Singular](http://habanero.math.cornell.edu:3691/).

Security is provided by starting every process in its own linux container. We recommend starting the web server from inside a virtual box for added security.

[Macaulay2](http://www.macaulay2.com) is a software system devoted to supporting research in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, whose creation and development have been funded by the National Science Foundation since 1992.

To get started, select a tutorial. Click on any highlighted code, Macaulay2 will execute it. The result is displayed on the right. Alternatively, you can use the Input Terminal on the left to write your own commands. Execute a line by positioning your cursor on it and click on the Evaluate button (or type Shift-Enter). You can switch back to the tutorial at any time.

The tutorials demonstrate different aspects of Macaulay2. They are meant to be starting points for your own experimentation. Edit the commands in the Input Terminal and run them again. Whenever you're ready to move on, click the Next button.

## Current status

Still a little hacked, but we think it's working. 

## Features

* Unrestricted [Macaulay2](http://www.macaulay2.com) shell
* Uploading Packages and other files is possible
* Rendering JPGs with e.g., Graphs.m2
* Running inside schroots


## Usage
    node lib/SingularLocalServer.js --schroot
    
By default, listening on port 8002. You can change this in SingularLocalServer.js.

## Installation
You can run

    node lib/SingularLocalServer.js
    
on your own machine visit the server on http://localhost:8002. If you have Macaulay2 installed, this gives you an (unsecured!) Macaulay2 shell. That means, through the browser you have access to your entire machine with the same permissions as the user that started m2server, i.e., you. 

### Secure server using schroots
You probably want to run 

    node SingularLocalServer.js --schroot
    
which will place every new user into its own (secure) chroot, thus not giving access to your system. Warning: Know what you are doing when you offer this service, we are not responsible if somebody finds a security hole! Follow the notes in schroot.tex

You need 
* node.js
* [Macaulay2](http://www.macaulay2.com)
* patched formidable: [https://github.com/fhinkel/node-formidable](https://github.com/fhinkel/node-formidable)
* different node packages, use npm install to get them (connect, cookies, )
* [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) to run server as a daemon, use npm install forever -g.
