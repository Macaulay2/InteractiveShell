First I installed schroot and debootstrap

\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt-get install schroot debootstrap
\end{verbatim}

Next I created the configuration file

\begin{verbatim}
cd /etc/schroot/chroot.d
touch precise_amd64.conf
\end{verbatim}

And filled it with the following content

\begin{verbatim}
[precise_amd64]
description=Ubuntu precise pangolin
directory=/home/lars/ubuntu-master/precise.chroot
root-users=lars
type=directory
users=lars,m2user
\end{verbatim}

Note that I already had the necessary folders created.
Also note that the root user is a user from the outer system. In this case, I (lars) will be able to schroot into this system without using sudo.
Then I installed precise into the directory

\begin{verbatim}
sudo debootstrap --variant=buildd --arch=amd64 precise 
  /home/lars/ubuntu-master/precise.chroot/ 
  http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
\end{verbatim}

Now one can list all schroots with

\begin{verbatim}
schroot -l
\end{verbatim}

One can enter the schroot using

\begin{verbatim}
schroot -c precise_amd64 -u root
\end{verbatim}

Note that you might get an error message depending on whether the folder you start the schroot in also exists in the schroot environment or not.

Schroot automatically mounts the /home folders. We don't want that, thus we deactivate this by commenting the /home line in /etc/schroot/mount-defaults. Actually we don't want to mount any folder from the outside to the schroot, so we comment all lines that aren't commented yet.
