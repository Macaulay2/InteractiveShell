\begin{abstract}

    A webversion of Macaulay2, a computer algebra system funded by the
    National Sciences Foundation since 1992. The webversion gives easy
    access to this sophisticated software without the hurdles that
    usually come with installing it. This is particularly useful for
    first time users and students as it is easy to try out. The
    webversion has all features that a desktop version has and can be
    used to its full potential. The webversion contains tutorials,
    that explain different concepts such as an introduction to
    Gr\"obner bases. Users can develop their own tutorials and provide
    them to their students, making it a great tool for education.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\begin{figure}[htb]
    \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{homeWebsite.jpg}
    \caption{Welcome screen of web version of Macaulay2. The left hand
      side shows a tutorial giving an introduction to Gr\"obner
      bases. Text in yellow can be clicked and is then executed by
      Macaulay2 on the server. The complete output of the calculations
      is show on the right hand side. {\it Home, Tutorial, Input} let
      the user change the left hand view, {\it Reset, Interrupt} allow
      to reset and interrupt the Macaulay2 session on the server, {\it
        Save} provides both the input and the output of the current
      session to the user as a text file, and with {\it Upload} one
      can upload files that can then be accessed by Macaulay2.}
    \label{fig:home}
\end{figure}

The online version of Macaulay2 has the same functionality as regular
Macaulay2, albeit the user has access to less resources than on his
own machine. The user can upload files and load packages, generate
files such as images, and has access to shell commands.


Motivation (simple for students, simple interface, no time for
installation in class, also usable for advanced users (no
limitations), other sites (Sage) had heavier interface)


\section{How to use the website}
The right hand side provides a shell like environment running
Macaulay2. You can type into it, as well as use the arrow keys for
navigating through your command history.

On the left hand side, the user can navigate between {\it Home}, {\it
  Tutorial}, and {\it Input}. {\it Home} shows the table of contents
of tutorials. {\it Tutorial} shows the currently selected
tutorial. Tutorials are interactive and contain executable pieces of
Macaulay2 code that are run by clicking on them. {\it Input} shows a
terminal window in which the user can type commands and execute them.

All code executed either by clicking on interactive parts in a
tutorial or by entering code in the {\it Input} window, appears on the
right hand side together with the output from Macaulay2 to those
results.

The {\it Reset} button resets a Macaulay2 session, i.e., stopping a
running calculation, deleting all variables, unloading all packages,
and loading the standard packages.

The {\it Interrupt} button stops a running calculation, without
resetting the Macaulay2 session.

\subsection{Features}

The user can run all Macaulay2 commands that are available in the
running version. To obtain the current version running on the server,
type {\tt version}. Loading packages is possible, too, with commands
such as {\tt loadPackage}. If packages are not available, they can be
uploaded to the users session, by clicking the {\it Upload file}
button. Similarly, any other file, such as text files, that one might
want to manipulate or read data from with Macaulay2 can be uploaded to
the user's session.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{withGraph.jpg}
    \caption{Screenshot of webversion of Macaulay2 after the user
      generated an image. Some Macaulay2 packages can generate
      graphs. By invoking the command {\tt displayGraph}, the image is
      generated on the server and displayed to the user.}
    \label{fig:graph}
\end{figure}

Results from a session can be retrieved by using the {\it Save}
button. If the user needs to retrieve files, that are stored in his
session, those can be retrieved by executing {\tt open} in the user's
session. If Macaulay2 generates graphs, those are shown to the user,
see Figure \ref{fig:graph}.

Session are usually being kept alive for several days, which allows
users to continue their work next time they access server.

\section{Internal structure, schroots}

One of the first questions that occurred to us in this context was
whether to offer a sandboxed version of M2 or M2 with full
functionality.  We settled for the second alternative, since it seemed
easier to realize and more likely to attract new users.  This lead to
several new questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A fully functional M2 also gives the user system access. How does that impact security and how to deal with it?
\item How do we distinguish the users on the system?
\item How can we limit resources to prevent one user from breaking the system? e.g. via fork bombs.
\item How do we clean up after a user has left?
%\item blablabla?
\end{enumerate}

The answer to the second question was to create and delete users on
the fly. Since this implies that the server must be run as root, we
decided to run it inside a virtual machine in order not to compromise
the security of the host system.


Since any system command can be run from inside M2 which is why we
decided to run M2 inside a `secure chroot' (schroot). To provide full
funtionality we mount a full system inside the schroot. The mounting
happens read only, a few folders are provided with a writable layer,
if M2 needs write access to them. In the definition of a user specific
schroot there is not root user, so it should not be possible to become
root or execute any command via sudo.

When a user connects to the server the following things happen:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A user account on the system is created.
\item A schroot configuration file is created with the above user as only user.
\item Control groups for memory and CPU are created.
\item The schroot is started.
\end{enumerate}

Control groups (cgroups) allow you to restrict the number of CPU
shares and the memory for a process and all its children. When M2 is
executed inside a schroot it is called via {\tt cgexec} with the
cgroups specifically created for this user. Using this technique it is
possible to limit the total consumption of CPU and memory by each
user. Additionally we ensure that the administrator of the virtual
machine always is able to execute any command required for
maintenance, i.e. if the node server is down or has been compromised.

Now any Macaulay2 command can be run in this schroot inside the
corresponding cgroups.

You can find a detailed description how to set up this environment on
\cite{trym2-github} in the file {\tt configuring\_linux.tex}.
